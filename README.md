## 📖 Overview

The **Serenify Frontend** is a modern, responsive single-page application built to provide an intuitive and calming user experience for mental health support. Developed with **Next.js 15 (App Router)** and **React 19**, it ensures blazing-fast performance, server-side rendering specific for SEO, and a seamless client-side navigation experience. The UI is crafted with **Tailwind CSS** and **Radix UI** primitives for accessible and customizable components.

Key features include:
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Real-Time Communication:** Integrated WebSockets (coming soon) for instant chat functionality.
- **Accessible UI:** built on top of unstyled, accessible components from Radix UI.
- **Form Management:** robust form validation using `React Hook Form` and `Zod`.
- **Modern State Management:** Efficient client-state handling with React Context and Hooks.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project utilizes the Next.js App Router for simplified routing and layout management:

## 🔐 Security Architecture (Client-Side E2EE & Privacy)

The Serenify Frontend implements state-of-the-art client-side cryptographic systems and sandbox safeguards to maintain absolute user privacy and satisfy regulatory requirements.

### 🔒 1. Client-Side End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
*   **Zero-Knowledge Storage:** Symmetric group room keys and device identity keypairs are kept within client-side memory and persisted as non-extractable Web Crypto API keys in browser **IndexedDB** databases. They are never sent to the backend.
*   **Hybrid Encryption:** Messages are symmetrically encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** using fresh message keys. These keys are asymmetrically wrapped under the server's Moderation Public Key using ECIES (**X25519** ECDH key exchange + AES-GCM wrapping) to support governed moderation reports.
*   **Cryptographic Binding & Ed25519 Signatures:** Ciphertext packets bind sender IDs and room identifiers to a SHA-256 digest, which is cryptographically signed using the client's **Ed25519** private identity key.

### 🛡️ 2. Privacy & Sandbox Hardening
*   **On-Device Safety Scan:** Rather than using central scanning servers that inspect plaintext messages, a **Web Worker thread** runs a local safety lexicon check directly in the user's browser, enabling crisis alerts and support counselor escalations locally.
*   **Strict Sandbox Headers (CSP):** Employs strict Content Security Policy configuration scripts to establish strict frame-ancestor limits and script origins, preventing malicious cross-site scripting (XSS) code injections from retrieving cryptographic keyrings.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v20 or higher)
- **npm** (v10+), **yarn**, or **pnpm**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnshRaj112/serenify-frontend.git
    cd serenify-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

    ```env
    # URL of the backend API
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server with **Turbopack** (for faster HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The page auto-updates as you edit `src/app/page.tsx`.

## 📜 Scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `dev` | `next dev --turbopack` | Starts the development server with Turbo. |
| `build` | `next build` | Builds the application for production deployment. |
| `start` | `next start` | Starts the production server (requires build first). |
| `lint` | `next lint` | Runs ESLint to identify and fix code quality issues. |

## 🎨 Styling & Theming

The application uses a custom Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) to define the color palette, typography, and spacing. Global styles are located in `src/app/globals.css`.

- **Dark Mode:** Support is built-in via the `next-themes` (if applicable) or manual CSS variables.
- **Components:** Found in `src/components/ui`, these are built using `shadcn/ui` patterns (Radix + Tailwind).

## 🧪 Testing & Linting

To ensure code quality, run the linter before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
```
